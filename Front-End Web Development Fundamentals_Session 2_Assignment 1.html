           <h1>Recipe</h1>
           <ol>
               <li>Mix together water, sugar and crushed cardamoms. Boil the syrup until it turns slightly sticky.
                   Switch of before it goes to a 1 string consistency. If it reaches a 1 string consistency, then add 2 tbsp of water and mix.
                   Add rose water and mix. Set aside to keep it hot.</li>
               <li>Mix together flour, milk powder and soda. Either sieve it or mix uniformly.</li>
               <li>Add ghee and mix well. Mix together yogurt and milk. Add 1.5 tbsp of this to the flour mixture. Begin to bring the flour togheter to make a
                   dough. The dough turns sticky. Grease your fingers and make a ball. The dough must not soggy. It must hold the shape well.</li>
               <li>Make 12 to 14 equal size balls and heat up the pan with ghee or oil. Also check if the syrup is hot. If it is not hot, heat it up bit.
                   It must be hot and not very hot.</li>
               <li>When the ghee is just medium hot, add the balls. Make sure the oil is not very hot else the gulab jamuns will brown without cooking well.
                   To check the right temperature, you can drop a small dough in the oil, it must rise slowly without changing its color. If it rises rapidly
                   then you need to cool the oil a bit before frying.</li>
               <li>Fry the balls until golden stirring uniformly.</li>
               <li>Add them to the hot syrup. Allow them to rest for 3 hours and serve. Garnish with pistachios.</li>
